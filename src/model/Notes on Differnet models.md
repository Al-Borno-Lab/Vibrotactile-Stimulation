## Notes:
- `1lifNetworkOFlogicMatteoUsed.py`
  - epoch current input matrix is a current input, it was incorrectly implemented in the dynamic conductance update function.
  - Subsequent model would have this fixed by migrating to the dynamic membrane potential function.
  - The code here has significant change in organization and variable names from the original class definition in the ipynb on Google Colab.
  - g_leak set to 10 instead of 0.02 as according to the paper
- `2lifNetworkFixedInputFromConductanceToVoltage.py`
  - This model has fixed the previous model's incorrect implementation of the epoch current input matrix by migrating the logic from the dynamic conductance update function to the dynamic membrane potnetial update function, aligning with equation (2) of Ali's paper.
  - All other variables remain the same from preivous model (i.e., `1lifNetworkOFlogicMatteoUsed.py`)
  - g_leak set to 10 instead of 0.02 as according to the paper
  - The dynamic voltage function is completely off from the paper.
  - **Abandoning iteratively fixing the model to show the difference.**
- `lifNetwork2.py`
  - Implements the "epoch_current_input" matrix as "external_spiked_input_w_sums".
  - Fixed various off variables such as g_leak set to 0.02 aligning with paper as opposed to 10 from Ali's code.
  - Unclear what and why tau_m is used: Jesse recommends Tony to look into STN firing frequency to validate which one to use for PD's STN.
    - To fix this, go into the `stimulate` method to comment out one of the value.
